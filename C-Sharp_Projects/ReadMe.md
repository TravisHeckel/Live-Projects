## Introduction
	I had the opportunity to work on a Live-Project for a two-week sprint. I was part of a team of developers working on an MVC/MVVM Web application using C#.during this project I was tasks with primarily providing the ability for a user to rent items from the owner and record data on those items to a database. We all had a chance to work on both the front-end and back-end content. And I was able to build some experience in project management and team building skills as we reviewed our work and consistently helped eachother with any problems we faced.


## MODEL and DATABASE 
	I spent the beginning part of this creating a model that woudl contain 3 classes. In the Rental.cs you can see the three classes with the two lower classes defining the items to be included in the main class. I had several different categories that we needed to include in each unit created. 

## CONTROLLER AND SCAFFFOLDING
	I also created a controller and use scaffolding (ASP.NET MVC feature) to generate the 4 pages I would have. In these pages I would have full CRUD functionality.  	

## LAYOUT AND STYLING
	The scaffolding created a very crude outline, So I spent time utilizing BootStrap in creating a better layout and styling each page.
	
## additional skills:
* I built up habits of saving my work constantly as I progressed as well as Debugging.

* we coordinated our work using Azure Devops, keeping us well organize and confirming that all of us working across the same versions.

* I learned the true value of GitHub as our team had multiple branches at work and several times we came across some merge conflicts and I was able to practice reviewing and creating a merge resolution. I also organized files and made sure to ignore specific files that would have otherwise affected the project at large.

* As a team we completed our daily standups everyday. I became very familiar with agile Framework as we discussed any problems, what work needs to be done, and what deadlines are set.

* I had a lot of time spent working on the layout and design with HTML and CSS.

*  was using the .Net framework. Learning this new system was quite a fun challenge coming from using a lot of Python, but I found more than enough references as well as trial and error to figure out its usage.  I also found that a lot more things can be streamlined and easier to code with these pre-determined functions.
